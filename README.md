TextCraft is a simple yet powerful React-based text manipulation tool built to streamline common text operations. Whether you need to convert your sentences to uppercase, lowercase, remove extra spaces, or quickly count characters and words, TextCraft gets the job done efficiently.

This project was developed by Anuj Mendhe as a part of my learning journey into modern front-end development with React. It serves as both a practical utility and a showcase of my skills in building interactive, user-friendly interfaces.
